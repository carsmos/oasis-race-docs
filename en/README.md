# 1 Overview of the Competition

## 1.1 Introduction to the Competition

The main goal of the Carsmos Open Source Autonomous Driving Algorithm Competition is to evaluate the driving ability of autonomous driving algorithms in real-world traffic scenarios.

Participants only need to register on the [**Competition Registration System**](https://race.carsmos.cn/), provide team information, and pass the audit to participate.

This competition is organized by[**Xi'an Shenxin Kechuang Information Technology Co., Ltd.**](https://guardstrike.com/)。

## 1.2 Competition Tasks

The competition is based on the [**Oasis Autonomous Driving Simulation Platform**](https://guardstrike.com/tech.html)，and tests autonomous driving algorithms through a set of predefined  [**scenarios**].

For each scenario, the autonomous driving vehicle controlled by the participant's algorithm will be initialized at a starting point and instructed to drive to a predefined endpoint. The scenario includes various elements such as weather, lighting conditions, traffic flow (vehicles, pedestrians), traffic lights, traffic signs, roadblocks, etc.

Participants' algorithms need to make reasonable use of various [**scenario information**](en/scenarios_en.md) and [**sensor information**]，provided by the system to enable the algorithm-controlled vehicle to smoothly pass through these predefined scenarios and strive to obtain higher scores in various [**evaluation indicators**].

## 1.3 How to Get Started

1. Register on the [**Competition Registration System**](https://race.carsmos.cn), create a team, invite teammates, or join a team to participate in the competition. Refer to the[**Registration System Operation Process**](en/signup_en.md).

2. Install and run the Oasis Competition Edition system according to the [__Installation and Deployment Document__](en/install_en.md), [click here to download the Oasis Competition Edition](https://carsmos.oss-cn-chengdu.aliyuncs.com/carsmos.tar.gz)。.

3. Familiarize yourself with the Oasis Competition Edition according to the [__Carsmos Development Guide__](start_en.md#_22-开始开发), and develop and test autonomous driving algorithms based on this.

4. Follow the prompts in the [**Competition Registration System**](https://race.carsmos.cn) and refer to Submitting Images to package the algorithm into an image and submit the image to the cloud for running results and scores.
