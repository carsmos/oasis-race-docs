# 1 Overview of the Competition

## 1.1 Introduction to the Competition

`2023 IEEE & OpenAtom Competition on Open-Source Autonomous Driving Algorithms` is based on the open source project of [**Yuan Ao**](https://www.carsmos.cn) and uses the autonomous driving simulation platform `OASIS` and middleware `DORA` to provide multiple predefined scenarios for participating teams to test the perception, planning, and decision-making abilities of their submitted autonomous driving algorithms in various complex traffic environments in urban areas. Winning teams in the simulation competition will be invited to participate in the **offline vehicle challenge**.

<!-- For each scenario, the autonomous driving vehicle controlled by the participant's algorithm will be initialized at a starting point and instructed to drive to a predefined endpoint. The scenario includes various elements such as weather, lighting conditions, traffic flow (vehicles, pedestrians), traffic lights, traffic signs, roadblocks, etc. -->

Participants' algorithms need to make reasonable use of various [**scenario information**](en/scenarios_en.md) and [**sensor information**]ï¼Œprovided by the system to enable the algorithm-controlled vehicle to smoothly pass through these predefined scenarios and strive to obtain higher scores in various [**evaluation indicators**].
