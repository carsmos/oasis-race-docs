# 5 Submit Algorithm

## 5.1 Submit Algorithm
- Perform operations in the algorithm submission system using the provided commands to submit the algorithm.
- Before submitting, please make sure to run it locally at least once, otherwise the cloud will not be able to recognize the paths of *my_agent.py* and *my_agent.yaml*.
- The first submission will take a relatively long time, while subsequent submissions will be completed quickly.
- Once the algorithm is successfully uploaded, the cloud will automatically run the participant's algorithm and provide real-time running status.
- Participants need to wait for a period of time (within 12 hours), and then they can see the running results of this submission in the "Submit History" section on the [**algorithm submission system**](https://competition.atomgit.com/competitionInfo?id=2e1cce10c89711edb4b22fd906d12a1e).

## 5.2 Competition Phase

- **Online Practice Phase**

    Before the official competition, as long as you register to participate, you can get free evaluation computing power on the online submission platform. You can have `two submission opportunities per day` for online practice, and there is no ranking in this stage. 
    
    The online scenarios running in this stage are public training scenarios. Details for [Scenarios](en/scenarios_en.md)ã€‚

- **Online Ranking Phase**

    After the official start of the competition, you need to submit your final algorithm within the specified time, and the competition will be ranked in real time according to the ranking score. 
    
    The online scenarios running in this stage are private competition scenarios.
