# 9. Terms and Conditions

Please read these terms and conditions carefully. Submitting an algorithm to this competition system implies that the participant has accepted these terms and conditions. If you do not agree with any part of these terms and conditions, please do not submit.

## 9.1 How to participate in the Carsmos Open Source Autonomous Driving Algorithm Competition? 

Participants can compete in this competition as individuals or as team members. An individual can form a team with multiple members. If any of the terms and conditions of this competition are violated, the competition organizer reserves the right to prohibit team members or even the entire team from participating.

Teams can submit their algorithms according to their own preferences until the submission limit is reached. The competition organizer reserves the right to provide additional computing power or submission times for participating teams.

## 9.2  How to submit your algorithm?

By submitting algorithms to this self-driving algorithm competition, participants and teams authorize the organizers of the competition to review and analyze the submitted materials to verify compliance with all the rules of the competition. The submitted code (Docker image) will only be used for evaluation purposes and will not be disclosed without the consent of the participants and teams.

## 9.3 Disqualification

It is not allowed to use any permission information provided by the **Carsmos Open Source Autonomous Driving Algorithm Competition** or any derivative products, including world coordinates, Carla Planner, or any type of ground truth. Submission materials that use this information will be rejected, and participants and teams will be disqualified from the competition.

If the organizers of the competition discover any behavior that violates these terms, attempts to circumvent the rules of the competition, or any other potentially dishonest behavior, we reserve the right to disqualify submissions and ban participants and teams from participating in the **Carsmos Open Source Autonomous Driving Algorithm Competition**.
